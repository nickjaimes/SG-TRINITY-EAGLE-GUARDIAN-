# 🦅 EAGLE EYE DESIGN SPECIFICATION  
**Safeway Guardian Global Perception & Threat Detection System**

---

## 🌍 System Purpose

EAGLE EYE is the *perception engine* — the system that detects what TRINITY AI cannot see alone.

Like a satellite monitoring Earth, EAGLE EYE collects incoming data from:

- SG OS (system health)
- Network & Cyber data
- SG SAFECOIN transactions
- Calamity & Climate data
- Health & national risk engines
- Future SG devices & sensors

## 🔁 Data Processing Flow

```text
RAW EVENT → NORMALIZATION → PATTERN MAPPING → ANOMALY DETECTION → ALERT → TRINITY RESPONSE


⸻

🔍 Example Feature Detection

Layer
Detection
System
CPU spike, memory leak
Finance
Abnormal SAFECOIN transfer
Climate
Temperature threshold break
Cyber
Port scan, brute force
Health
Infection rate increase


⸻

📦 Core Functions
def collect_and_process(events):
    # Normalizes raw input logs into structured format
    return normalized_signals

def detect_anomalies(signals):
    # Flags unusual patterns
    return alerts

def encode_symbol(alert):
    # Convert alert to SG symbolic format (ex: C81 for climate-high urgency)
    return symbol


⸻

🗿 Symbol Encoding (Göbekli Tepe Inspired)
<DOMAIN><RISK><URGENCY>
C81 → Climate / risk8 / urgency1
F97 → Finance emergency


⸻

🤝 Integrations
